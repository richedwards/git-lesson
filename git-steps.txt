Git steps

Forked a repository that created our own copy of the code.
Created a directory for our project to live locally.
Cloned repository by pressing button on Github.
In Terminal, we typed git clone and pasted clone URL.
Change into directory we created.
Open our text editor.
Make changes / corrections.
Run git diff in Terminal to see differences.
Add file to the staging area (using git add [filename]).
Then we commit our changed files using git commit -m (with an added message of explanation).
The final step is to push it up using git push origin master.
Send pull request to let others know changes were made.
